        <div class="page">
                <p class="intro dark">About</p>
                <h1>Throughout my career, I've embraced every challenge as an opportunity to create impactful experiences — for users, businesses, and the teams I've had the privilege to lead.</h1>

                <div class="intro">

                    <p class="fade">From running my own design studio in Italy to leading global digital transformations for iconic brands like Nespresso, Richemont, and Mews, my journey has been one of continuous learning, growth, and reinvention. I've scaled design teams across industries, built design systems that ensure consistency and scalability, and driven business outcomes through user-centered solutions. Along the way, I've learned to balance creativity with strategic thinking, ensuring that design efforts align with both user needs and business goals.</p>

                    <h2 class="fade">My Beliefs and Values</h2>

                    <h3 class="fade">Clear Vision</h3>
                    <p class="fade">I believe in the power of a vision, designing today for tomorrow's successful products. Great design starts with a clear direction and an understanding of what we want to achieve. It's about anticipating future needs and setting the course to meet them through thoughtful, intentional design.</p>

                    <h3 class="fade">Servant Leadership</h3>
                    <p class="fade">I lead with empathy and enthusiasm, helping teams to perform and fostering collaboration. My leadership philosophy is rooted in empowering those around me to achieve their best work. By nurturing a culture of trust and shared purpose, I believe we can unlock innovation and create meaningful impact.</p>

                    <h3 class="fade">Continuous Innovation</h3>
                    <p class="fade">I enjoy challenging the usual way of doing things to create innovative solutions that exceed expectations. I'm driven by curiosity and the desire to push boundaries, always seeking better ways to solve problems and deliver value.</p>

                    <h3 class="fade">Uncompromised Quality</h3>
                    <p class="fade">At any stage of the process, I believe that attention to detail is what makes great design stand out. Craftsmanship matters — from the big picture to the smallest details — and it's this relentless pursuit of excellence that creates memorable experiences.</p>

                    <h2 class="fade">My Approach to Design Leadership</h2>
                    <p class="fade">Design leadership, for me, is about more than just delivering great products. It's about fostering a culture of collaboration, learning, and continuous improvement. I believe that the best solutions come from diverse perspectives, and I strive to create environments where everyone feels empowered to contribute.</p>
                    <p class="fade">I've built and scaled design teams, creating frameworks and systems that not only deliver consistency but also enable creativity. I've partnered with cross-functional teams to ensure that design is integrated into every aspect of product development, from strategy to execution. And I've worked tirelessly to advocate for design as a driver of business success.</p>

                    <h2 class="fade">Why I Do What I Do</h2>
                    <p class="fade">What drives me is the belief that design has the power to make a difference — to improve how people interact with the world, to create new business opportunities, and to build stronger, more engaged teams. I see design as a force for positive change, and I'm passionate about using my skills and experience to help organizations achieve their goals while delivering exceptional user experiences.</p>
                    <p class="fade">Whether it's transforming the way hotels manage operations, creating seamless e-commerce experiences, or launching new ventures, my mission is to craft solutions that are both innovative and impactful.</p>
